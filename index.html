								<h2><a href="#">Analysis of British Airways Customer Reviews <br />
								</a></h2>
							</header>
							<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/BA2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p> OVERVIEW: I used the British Airways  customer review data collected between 2016 to 2023. 
								METHODS: I have focused my analysis on 6 service categories provided by the airline.
								I have initially cleaned and explored the data in Python (link below).
								I have generated a very user friendly and interactive dashboard in Tableau (link below) presenting the average customer ratings based on the time series, 
								Continent, type of aircraft, number of reviews and a map displaying the countries from where the data has been collected.
								INFERENCES: European Union and North America has the highest number of reviews when compared to other countries. 
								Among the services provided by the air line, highest rating is assoiated with cabin staff service, followed by ground service.
 Lowest rating is associated with food and beverages followed by entertainment. We can notice that there is no difference in ratings before and after Covid-19.

										<h2><a href="#">Analysis of Airbnb data in Seatle in Tableau<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/airbnb2.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: I used an existing Airbnb data in Seattle in order to start an airbnb in the area
										 while maximizing profits.
										OBJECTIVE: Where, when and the size of the house required to start an Airbnb in Seattle and obtain maximum profits.
										METHODS: 1) I identified the neighborhoods with highest price per night, using zipcode data. I plotted the top 5 neighbourhoods with highest earnings on the Seattle map.
										2) I identified the time of the year that gives the maximum yields and 3) I identified average yields based on the number of bed rooms in a house and number of listings according to the number of bedrooms.
										INFERENCES: In order to earn maximum profits from an Airbnb, I would suggest to open an Airbnb around the downtown area of Seattle, during early spring. We can opt for eithrt 2-3 bedroom houses
										as they can provide higher yields with a relatively lower competition than a one bedroom house. A 2-3 bedroom house is also associated with lower investment levels when compared to a house with 4-6 bedrooms.
										Future recommendations: We can further look into the year around occupany and total earnings of Airbnbs based on the number of bedrooms for a deeper understanding of the profits earned and can improvise recommendations accordingly.

										<h2><a href="#">Analysis of air pollution data in Tableau<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/airpolution.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>PROJECT DESCRIPTION: I used the air pollution measurements collected in Montreal area during summer and during winter.
										Using the box plot, I showed that the levels of air pollution and variability in air pollution are higher during winter than during summer.
										Among weekdays, the air pollution levels are higher on Fridays, followed by Monday in both seasons.
										Airport, Highways and petroleum refineries have higher levels of air pollution and this trend is more evident during winter, possibly associated with higher air pollution levels and variability in winter. In addition, Downtown area has highest pollution.

										<h2><a href="#">Data exploration and correlation in Python<br />
										</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/python2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>	PROJECT DESCRIPTION: I used data from Hollywood movies to understand the determinats of a movie success.
										I explored factors that influence the success of a movie in terms of gross revenue. I replaced the null values in the data set with the mean and removed any duplicates in the data set. I factorized the categorical variables in order to be able to perofrm correlation. I also generated heatmaps to be able to easily visualize the correlation structure in the data. I found that the budget for the movie and the voting from the audience have a great impact on the success of a move.
